# Credit Card Customer Segmentation 
- This project focuses on **customer segmentation** to analyze customer data, identify distinct segments, and predict future cluster memberships for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer interactions

- Exploratory Data Analysis **(EDA)** to understand the dataset
- **K-means** clustering for grouping similar customers based on characteristics
- Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis **(PCA)** and **autoencoders**
- **Logistic Regression** is utilized to predict future customer clusters based on their features
<br>

# Key Features:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](#exploratory-data-analysis-eda)
- [K-means Clustering & PCA & Autoencoder for Dimensionality Reduction](#k-means)
- [Logistic Regression for Future Cluster Prediction](#logistic-regression)
